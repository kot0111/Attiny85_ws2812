# Attiny85_ws2812
Control of the address LED strip using the attiny85 microcontroller.

This project includes a header file that describes the basic functions for controlling the address LED strip on ws2812 chips, and an executive file responsible for switching the LED glow modes. If desired, you can, by throwing out some functions, fit this program in the attiny13a memory
